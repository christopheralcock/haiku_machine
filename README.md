Hello!

This program started as a [haiku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku_in_English) machine, with the idea being that it would ask you for some phrases and how many syllables you consider them to have, and give them back to you in a random order, a la , as a five syllable lines followed by a seven syllable line and another five syllable line.  (I know that technically haikus don't actually have a 5-7-5 syllable structure, but people think they do enough for it to be how the program works.)

Anyway, as I was doing it I realised that it would be fun for it to be expandable to other syllable counts, so that you could use it to generate
