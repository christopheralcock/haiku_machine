Phase 1:
Create a Haiku machine that asks for a word, and then how many syllables the user considers the word to have for the purpose of the (technically inaccurate) 5-7-5 haiku.
machine requires words whose syllables can make 5 and 7 syllable groups 
eg if the inputs were all two syllable words it would have to return an error, which would ask for a one syllable filler which could be used to make weight.  I could prepopulate the library with a few words I guess, but that'd be less satisfying i think.
Phase 2:
machine spits out a 5-7-5 haiku.
Phase 3:
stores haiku in library of them
Phase 4:
allows you to recall haiku by a reference number
